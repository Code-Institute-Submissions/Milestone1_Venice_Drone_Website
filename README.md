Need to get an example read me to use! 

8th may - 
- found a boilerplate that could help me that is basic stuff and wont over saturate the vibe of the page called Skeleton. 
- this is mental tough
- 3rd re-start - this time, I am going to build on a blank frame work. No boiler plate stuff. 
  Let's see if I can make this on standard html and css. 
- lost everything 3 times now due to git hub crashing.
