# Venice Drone Fan Website

This is the first assignement of the Full Stack Development course with Code Institute. This web site will showcase an understanding of HTML5 and CSS3 along with Bootstrap 4.5 in a user-facing static webfront for a rock band called Venice Drone.

This site will showcase the latest releases, make an archive of releases available to click to, let users see upcoming gig dates with links to buy tickets and give a wealth of communication options depending on how, and in what capacity, they want to get intouch with the band.

## UX

### **Design Theory**

The user experience is focused site-wide. The Venice Drone fanbase have a wide age range, so this site must be useable by teens and adults. For that reason each content section is seperated by a title header in a bold colour with to-the-point titles, and nice spacious margins around the content that is in focus for that section, which changes depending on view height.  

I wanted to achieve a useable website, with a tone and copy that represented the bands precise and to-the-point nature. For this reason only the content that is new and being promoted is on the front page. And more content is under the nav bar sections on other pages. 

They are a secretive, non-ego driven band with very little desire to share personal stories and damage the music with their own images. For this reason a 'about me' section was omitted.

The site is designed to be easily modifiable, since Venice Drone are an active band, when more content is released, it can easily be added to the site, and copied to the front page for a feature.

### **Reference and tone**
Other similar sites I referenced were *Radioheads* 'WASTE' site (<https://www.wasteheadquarters.com/>) and *Idles* website (<https://www.idlesband.com/>) Particlarly the titles, dimentions, simplicity and direct tone.

-----------------------------

### **Design Choices**

The main colour theme was around the title bar blue, which is a muted colour that the band uses for logos. I then picked the theme based on that colour, using Coolers (<https://coolors.co/>) and highlted a dull but contrasting red for highlighted notes.

Colour Palette

* ![#6d95aa](https://placehold.it/15/6d95aa/000000?text=+) `#6d95aa` - Muted Teal / Main Banner / Logo color
* ![#b54c49](https://placehold.it/15/b54c49/000000?text=+) `#b54c49` - Mute Red / Alert / Focus color
* ![#bec1b9](https://placehold.it/15/bec1b9/000000?text=+) `#bec1b9` - Off-Grey / background color
* ![#eaebea](https://placehold.it/15/eaebea/000000?text+=) `#eaebea` - Off-White text color
* ![#161614](https://placehold.it/15/161614/000000?text=+) `#161614` - Off-Black text color

Fonts
I used a sans-serif for the main font, the sharpness off DM Mono was what I settled on.

and a secondary font of Roboto.

### _User Stories:_

* As a long time fan of the band, I want to see the latest content at first glance and feel up to date. 
* As a new and curious fan of the band, I want to click through quickly and get a feel for what Venice Drone are.
* As a club promoter, I want to get to the bands contact information as quickly as possible and contact them about a performance.
* As a music lover, I want to listen to the bands music on my chosen platform.

### _Wireframes:_

![Radiohead website screenshot](assets/img/Readmerefimgs/radiohead_ref.png "radiohead screenshot")


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

### _Feature 1_




In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
